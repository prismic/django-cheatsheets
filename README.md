Django-cheatsheets
==================

As a beginner to Django, I did the usual programmer thing when learning a new framework: google a lot, read mailing list entries, and try to write an application on my own.  This proved to be a somewhat unfulfilling experience, as most information found on google are out of date; the documentation has a lot of great information for beginners, but doesn't make it easy to find (especially hard when you don't know that thing is what you need!).  And while mailing lists are great place to ask questions, it isn't a great place to search for information and find what you want.

Over time, I have found that a lot of what I want to do, it could be done with just knowing what methods and attributes are available to me at that moment, and if that wasn't enough, then experiment with overriding methods.  To help with that, I have started building my own cheat sheets of important, frequently used objects in django for when one did not exist.  This is the repository for that.

If you are looking a general django cheat sheet, I highly recommend the following:

http://ccbv.co.uk/ (class-based views reference.  Very handy!  I hope to put this into cheat sheet form at some point.)
